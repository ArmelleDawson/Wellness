# Wellness
## Purpose
This repo contains the skelleton for a website focused on wellness. Currently it is just an html with some finctionality that I have been trying out.

## How to run
It is as simple as accessing the initial html. Open a browser and go to: file:///Users/armelle/Git/Fitness/html/FitnessOnTheWeb.html

## Plans
The plan is to use this codebase as a learning ground and to build an app tailored to how I want to track wellness.
